This project runs a boosting algorithm to identify which credit card holder will default ( as in is a high risk for the issuing card bank )
This Project was a part of a Hackathon I participated in and these are the submissions I learnt a lot from this Problem and hope whooever is reading this can too




I coded this in Kaggle due to insufficient resources! 
(The Training and the test set are in the repo)
